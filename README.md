# 🔢 Sorting Algorithm Visualizer (C++ Console-Based)

An interactive terminal-based visualizer for popular sorting algorithms: **Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort**. This project demonstrates strong command over **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** by animating each sorting step in real time using color-coded bars, swap/comparison counters, and execution metrics.

## 🛠️ Features

- 🎨 Real-time console visualization using ASCII blocks and ANSI colors
- 🔁 Supports multiple algorithms: Bubble, Selection, Insertion
- ⬆️⬇️ Ascending and descending order sorting
- ⌛ Adjustable visualization speed (1–10 levels)
- 📊 Displays total comparisons, swaps, and time taken
- 🎲 Random or manual array input options

## 📌 Algorithms Covered

- **Bubble Sort**  
- **Selection Sort**  
- **Insertion Sort**  

Each algorithm highlights:
- Elements being compared (🔴 Red)
- Elements being swapped (🟢 Green)
- Sorted section of array (🔵 Blue)
